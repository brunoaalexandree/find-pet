# About this project

This project was a skills test that I developed for Zenit.

It's a simple project where users will have access to photos of pets, pets in general, etc.

In the project I found some challenges, starting with the suggested technologies where I had to read a little to know how I would fit them into the project. I made a topic below showing the technologies used in the project.
